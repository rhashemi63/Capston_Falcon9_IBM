### Space-X-Project

The project task is to predict if the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully. Data science methodologies have been applied to analyze launch data and optimize the prediction of launches. SpaceX can reuse the first stage.
First, we get the data from API or using web scraping and convert it to DataFrame
Then we clean the data and handle missing values
Finally, we use four machine learning methods to estimate the best model.
