The project task is to predicting if the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully. Data science methodologies have been applied to analyse launch data and optimise prediction of launches. SpaceX can reuse the first stage.
First we get the data from API or using web scraping and convert it to DataFrame
Then we clean the data an handle missing values
Finally we use foure machine learning methods to estimate the best model.
